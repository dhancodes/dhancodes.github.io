- I use [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/), a user-friendly and widely supported Linux distribution along with
  [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/), a  tiling window manager.
- I love using [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) to create and modify text documents.
- For typesetting I prefer [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and when more mathematical equations are involved I turn to [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).
- If you want to practice programming, see [Python Practice book.](https://anandology.com/python-practice-book/), [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), [python challenges](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/).
