The tribulations of academia lie in our continued reliance on emails. An
unencrypted multitude of email addresses abounds, yet the challenge remains in
managing them all.  &#8230;</q> &#8211; anon

Worry no moreâ€”here's how to use one email to rule them all.

## Level 1: Email Forwarding

Every email service has an email forwarding option, though some are not free. I
assume that either your university or you are smart enough to use a service that
provides this feature. As gmail offers this service I will explain it in terms
of gmail.

Disclaimer: Even though I use Gmail, I am not endorsing it. Unfortunately, Gmail
uses an unencrypted protocol for communication.
**Step 1** : Go to settings
**Step 2** : Click on Forwarding and POP/IMAP
**Step 3** : Add a forwarding address.
**Step 4** : Verfiy your account and do the other things
...
**Step n** : You have successfully added an email address to forward all your
mails to.


## Level 2: Send Emails Without Logging into Your Secondary Account

In Gmail you find this option under Settings > Accounts and Import > Send mail
as.

Cheers!
