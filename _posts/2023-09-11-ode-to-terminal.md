To my usual readers, if there are any out there, I'd like to ask for a bit of
space because I'm about to go on a poetic rant.

---

In tech's vast world, I'll take some space,  
To share my thoughts and make my case.  
In praise of something pure and true,  
The terminal's charm, I'll give my due.  
  
In the world of tech, simplicity we find,  
Within the terminal, a connection so fine.  
Why seek mediators, distant they stand,  
When we can speak closely, hand in hand.  
  
Why carry the weight of unnecessary freight,  
When we can travel light, appreciate?  
I'd choose you, my love, again and again,  
Even if it meant joining the cult of 6, my friend.  
  
In this digital sea, vast and true,  
The only seashell I desire is you.  
In this ocean of options so grand,  
The one I desire, you understand.
