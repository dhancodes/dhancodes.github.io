In our modern world, the Internet has become an overwhelming sea of information. But have we truly mastered the art of navigating it? While the Internet presents itself differently to each individual, we often find ourselves at the mercy of bloated interfaces and algorithms that dictate what we see. However, there is a time-tested solution that empowers us to take control of our information consumption: Rich Site Summary (RSS), also known as Really Simple Syndication. Let's take a step back in time and explore the power of RSS.

## The Savior from the Past: RSS
You may have noticed the distinctive orange RSS logo on various blogs. This logo represents a button that carries a link, allowing you to copy and save it to an RSS reader. An RSS reader is an application specifically designed to consume these feeds. By setting up an RSS reader, you can stay updated whenever a new post is published on a blog, a newspaper site, a YouTube channel, Reddit, or even your favorite Twitter accounts (although the process for Twitter can be a bit cumbersome). The initial setup may take some time, but the key benefit is that you regain control over the information you receive.

## Embrace Freedom
By utilizing RSS, you liberate yourself from the clutches of algorithmic recommendations and personalized feeds. Instead, you become the curator of your own information sources. You decide which blogs, news sites, or channels to subscribe to, and you receive updates from them directly. This empowers you to break free from the echo chambers and filter bubbles that dominate the modern Internet landscape.

## Choosing an RSS Reader
There are numerous RSS readers available, catering to different platforms and preferences. Personally, I use newsboat, which is available in the apt repository for my laptop, and the Feed Reader app, available on F-Droid, for my Android device. However, a simple search will reveal a wide array of choices, allowing you to find the reader that best suits your needs.

## Conclusion:
Navigating the Internet doesn't have to be a passive experience dictated by algorithms. With RSS, we can reclaim control over our information consumption. By using an RSS reader and subscribing to the sources we trust and enjoy, we break free from the limitations imposed upon us. Embrace the power of RSS and explore the wealth of information available on your terms. Happy browsing!
