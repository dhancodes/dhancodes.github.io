Tattoos serve as personal expressions, etching permanent reminders on our
bodies. Recently, I made the bold decision to ink a tattoo on my hand—a
symbolic journey encapsulating the essence of "一期一会" (ichigo ichi-e),
treasuring each moment as a unique encounter.

## The Meaning Behind "一期一会":
"一期一会" embodies treasuring life's fleeting moments. It reminds me to
appreciate every encounter, relationship, and experience as a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. This philosophy inspires mindful living and
cherishing the present.

This tattoo acts as a constant companion, guiding me on my path, reminding me
to embrace the beauty of impermanence and to savor each passing moment with a
full heart.

Disclaimer: The decision to get a tattoo is deeply personal. Before getting a
tattoo, it is important to carefully consider the design, placement, and
long-term implications. Additionally, ensure you choose a reputable tattoo
artist who understands your vision and executes it safely and professionally.
