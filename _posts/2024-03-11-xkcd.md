Everyone requires a stress release to avoid mental and physical breakdowns.
Enter [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/), Randall Munroe's webcomic. If science, math,
or programming tickle your funny bone, the stick-figure comics are a must-read.
Indulge in [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) at your leisure and utilize [explainxkcd](https://www.explainxkcd.com/) for clarifications
and don't overlook the captions. Here are a few of my all-time favorites.
